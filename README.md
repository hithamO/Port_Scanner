# Port_Scanner

This is a simple Python script for scanning ports on a target machine. It allows you to specify a target IP address and scans a range of ports to check for open ports.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
```
python3 scanner.py <ip_address>
```

Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address of the target machine you want to scan.

## Features

- Scans a range of ports (default range: 50-85).
- Prints a message for each open port found during the scan.
- Handles errors gracefully and provides informative messages to the user.
